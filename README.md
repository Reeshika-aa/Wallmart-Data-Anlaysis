This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. 

Requirements: 

Python 3.8+
SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2
Kaggle API Key (for data downloading)

Project Structure:

|-- data/                     # Raw data and transformed data
|-- sql_queries/              # SQL scripts for analysis and queries
|-- notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks for Python analysis
|-- requirements.txt          # List of required Python libraries
|-- main.py                   # Main script for loading, cleaning, and processing data


STEPS:
Setup Environment: Use VS Code, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL. Organize folders (data/, scripts/, notebooks/).

Kaggle API: Download kaggle.json, place in ~/.kaggle/, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>
Download Data: Save the Walmart sales dataset to data/.

Install & Load:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.read_csv('data/walmart_sales.csv')
Explore Data: Use .info(), .describe(), .head().

Clean Data: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, convert types, format currency.

Feature Engineering: Add total_amount = unit_price * quantity.

Load to SQL: Use SQLAlchemy to push data to MySQL & PostgreSQL.

SQL Analysis: Write queries for revenue trends, best-sellers, sales by time/city/method, and profit margins.
